			<h3>Basic parts of the web</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					The web is an enormous network of computers that communicate with each other. The <em>user</em> accesses the web through a computer with a <em>web browser</em>.  Through the <em>internet</em> the browser is able to obtain html documents from various <em> servers</em> using <em>http</em>. Those documents are then interpreted by the browser and displayed to the user in the manner which the programmers intended.

			<h3>HTML</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language. It is the basis for everything on the web. HTML is made up of <em>text content</em>, which is "what you see" and <em>markup</em>, which is "how it looks."

			<h3>HTML attributes - elements/tags</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					HTML documents consist of <em>elements</em>, which include various <em>tags</em> that tell the browser how to display the document.

			<h3>Computers are stupid</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Programmers like to say that computers are stupid because they do not think for themselves. They do exactly as they are told. So, any little typo or other minor error can cause a computer to fail to carry out the program. On the other hand, because they do exactly as commanded, this gives programmers a lot of power if they understand how to correctly provide the necessary commands.

			<h3>Inline and block elements</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					There is an important distinction to be made between inline elements and block elements.  Simply put, block elements construct an invisible box around the text, allowing it to be altered in various other ways. For more information, click <a href="www.udacity.com">here</a>.

			<h3>Developer tools (in the Browser)</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					The developer tools in Google Chrome allow one to see how the browser is interpreting the HTML and CSS code.  This can be a helpful tool in making sure the website is displayed the way that it should be.

			<h3>The tree-like structure of HTML</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					HTML code is structured in a tree-like manner, where each element can branch out and contain multiple other elements within it.

			<h3>Programmer tools</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Programmers use tools such as text editors which can help write code with fewer errors.  They can automate some parts of the code-writing process, such as automatically generating a closing HTML tag when the programmer types in the opening tag.

	<h2>Lesson 1.3: Adding CSS style to HTML structure.</h2>
		<div class="concept">
			<div class="concept-title">
			<h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					CSS is used to give style to the HTML document.  With CSS the programmer can easily change such things as the colors of the text and background, the font type and size, the margins, etc.  By assigning classes to the various HTML elements, the programmer can then use CSS to simultaneously change all of the elements of the same class.  This avoids repetion, which is more effecient and reduces the chances of error.
